		<h2 id="alpn">Recommended Behavior for ALPN</h2>
		<p>Implementing these countermeasures is effective in
			preventing cross-protocol attacks irregardless of hostnames
			and ports used for application servers. The most important
			recommendations are highlighted below.</p>
		<h3 id="alpn-servers">ALPN for Servers</h3>
		<p class="important">
			We recommend that the server aborts the handshake if the
			client sends the ALPN extension, but the list of protocols
			does not include a protocol supported by the server.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also recommend that the server acknowledge the ALPN
			extension, so the client can verify that the server
			supports ALPN and selected a valid protocol.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not recommend that the server aborts the handshake if
			the client does not send the ALPN extension, unless
			backwards compatibility wth legacy clients that do not
			support ALPN is not a concern.
		</p>

		<h3 id="alpn-clients">ALPN for Clients</h3>
		<p class="important">
			We recommend that the client sends the ALPN extension with
			a list of the intended protocols, and the SNI extension
			with the intended hostname.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also recommend that the client aborts the handshake if
			the server acknowledges the ALPN extension, but does not
			select a protocol from the client list.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not recommend that the client aborts the handshake if
			the server does not acknowledge the ALPN extension, unless
			backwards compatibility with legacy servers that do not
			support or acknowledge the ALPN extension is not a concern.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sni">Recommended Behavior for SNI</h2>
		<p>
			Implementing these countermeasures is effective in
			preventing same-protocol attacks on servers with different
			hostnames, as well as cross-protocol attacks on servers
			with different hostnames even if the ALPN countermeasures
			can not be implemented.
		</p>
		<p>
			Compared to ALPN, the SNI extension is more difficult to
			configure, because the application server needs to be aware
			of its configuration in the network. While the supported
			protocol list for ALPN is usually determined statically at
			time of development of the application server, the list of
			acceptable hostnames for SNI is dependent on the location
			of the server in the network, and how it is accessed by
			clients, for example through the use of gateway and proxy
			servers. We recognize that in complicated deployment
			scenarios, implementing the following recommendations can
			be challenging. <strong>In particular, implementing these
				SNI-based countermeasures can potentially break legitimate
				connections that depend on inappropriately configured
				legacy environments, such as SNI fallback for unknown
				hosts.</strong>
		</p>

		<h3 id="sni-servers">SNI for Servers</h3>
		<p class="important">
			We recommend that the server aborts the handshake if the
			client sends an SNI hostname that the server does not
			recognize.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also recommend that the server acknowledges the SNI
			hostname to the client so the client can verify that the
			server supports SNI and recognized the hostname.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not recommend that the server aborts the handshake if
			the client does not send an SNI hostname, unless backwards
			compatibility wth legacy clients that do not support SNI is
			not a concern.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sni-clients">SNI for Clients</h3>
		<p class="important">
			We recommend that all clients are configured to send the
			SNI extension with the hostname of the intended server.
		</p>
		<p>
			We also recommend that clients abort the handshake if the
			server acknowledges the SNI hostname with a different
			hostname than the one sent by the client.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not recommend that clients abort the handshake if the
			server does not acknowledge the SNI hostname, unless
			backwards compatibility with legacy servers that do not
			support or acknowledge the SNI hostname is not a concern.

		<h3 id="openssl">OpenSSL</h3>
		<h4 id="openssl-alpn">ALPN Support in OpenSSL</h4>
		<p>
			ALPN selection in the client is supported
			by <a
				href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/SSL_set_alpn_protos.html">SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos()</a>,
			which takes as input a list of supported protocols for

		</p>
		<p>
			ALPN selection in the server is supported by an application

			with <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb.html">
				<code>SSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb()</code></a>. The
			callback should return one of three values:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK</code>: ALPN protocol
				selected. The connection continues.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</code>: There was no
				overlap between the client's supplied list and the
				server configuration. The connection will be aborted.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK</code>: ALPN protocol not
				selected, e.g., because no ALPN protocols are
				configured for this connection. The connection
				continues.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note that if there is no ALPN proposed in the
			ClientHello, the callback is not invoked.</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with OpenSSL and ALPN,
			the client should configure the supported protocols
			with <code>SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos()</code>, and the
			server should configure
			the <code>SSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb</code> callback. If
			an expected protocol identifier is provided, the server
			should return <code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK</code>, otherwise
			it should return <code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</code>.
		</p>
		<h4 id="openssl-sni">SNI Support in OpenSSL</h4>
		<p>
			The SNI hostname is set in the client by
			calling <a
				href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_set_tlsext_host_name.html">SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the server, SNI selection is supported by an application
			callback set
			with <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback.html">
				<code>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback()</code></a>. The

				accepted. The connection continues.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</code>: SNI hostname
				is not accepted. The connection is aborted.
			</li>
			<li>

			<li>
				<code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK</code>: SNI hostname is not
				accepted and not acknowledged, e.g. if SNI has not been
				configured. The connection continues.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with OpenSSL and SNI, the
			client should configure the SNI hostname
			with <code>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</code>, and the
			server should
			configure <code>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback()</code>. If
			a matching SNI hostname is sent by the client, the server
			should return
			<code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK</code>, otherwise it should
			return <code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</code>.
			<!-- Note that if there is no SNI hostname in the
	     ClientHello, the callback is not invoked.-->
		</p>

		<h3 id="java">Oracle Java</h3>
		<h4 id="java-alpn">ALPN Support in Java</h4>
		<p>
			The TLS stack in Java implements strict ALPN verification by
			default. The server and the client can configure ALPN support by passing
			acceptable values to the <code>SSLParameters</code>
			configuration object using
			the <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLParameters.getSSLParameters</code> method,
			which is then passed to the SSLEngine/SSLSocket to be
			configured. Overlapping values will be selected.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alternatively, the server can examine the values of the client
			ALPN extension and its own SSLSocket/SSLEngine before a
			protocol is negotiated, using
			the <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector</code>
			callback function. The function must return a String value
			that is in the client's list, and takes priority over
			the <code>SSLParameters</code> list. The function can also
			return the empty string if ALPN should not be acknowledged by
			the server, and null (or a String value not in the client's
			list) to abort the connection with
			a <code>no_application_protocol</code> alert.
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with Java and ALPN, the
			client should set the list of supported protocols with
			the <code>getSSLParameters</code> method, and the server
			should either do the same or implement
			the <code>setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelect</code> and
			return either a recognized protocol or null to abort the
			handshake.
		</p>

		<h4 id="java-sni">SNI Support in Java</h4>
		<p>
			The server can use <code>SSLParameters.setSNIMatchers</code>
			to enable strict hostname verification.
		</p>
		<p>
			The client can set the SNI hostname
			with <code>SSLParameters.setServerNames</code>.
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with Java and SNI, the
			client should set the SNI hostname
			with <code>SSLParameters.setServerNames</code>, and the server
			should set a SNI matcher
			with <code>SSLParameters.setSNIMatchers</code> that returns
			true if the hostname is recognized and false to abort the
			handshake.
		</p>

		<h3 id="golang">GoLang (crypto/tls)</h3>
		<h4 id="golang-alpn">ALPN Support in GoLang</h4>
		<p>The client and server can be configured to negotiate a
			protocol using the <code>tls.Config.NextProtos</code>
			field. At the time of writing (2021-02-16), the handshake
			will not be aborted on the client side if the server ignores
			the clients ALPN extension, or on the server side if the
			server does not support any of the clients requested
			protocols. However, application developers can still
			implement stricter enforcement by setting
			the <code>tls.Config.VerifyConnection</code> callback,
			although this is considered an advanced pattern.</p>
		<p>Note: The default behavior might change in the future to
			implement strict checking according to RFC 7301.</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with GoLang and ALPN, the
			client and server should configure the supported protocols
			in <code>tls.Config.NextProtos</code>, and the server
			should abort the handshake if no protocol can be
			negotiated, using manual verification in the
			<code>tls.Config.VerifyConnection</code> callback. If and
			when the default behavior changes to enforce strict ALPN
			verification, this custom callback can be removed.
		</p>

		<h4 id="golang-sni">SNI Support in GoLang</h4>
		<p>The server does not strictly enforce the SNI
			hostname. Instead, the SNI hostname is used to select the
			right certificate if multiple certificates are
			configured. However, application developers can still
			implement stricter enforcement by setting the
			<code>tls.Config.VerifyConnection</code>, although this is
			considered an advanced pattern.
		</p>
		<p>On the client side, setting
			the <code>tls.Config.ServerName</code> is required. This is
			sent in the ClientHello and used to verify the certificate
			provided by the server, unless certificate verification is
			disabled.
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with GoLang and SNI, the
			client should configure the SNI hostname
			in <code>tls.Config.ServerName</code>, and the server
			should abort the handshake if the client provided an SNI
			hostname that is not recognized, using manual verification
			in the
			<code>tls.Config.VerifyConnection</code> callback.

		<h3 id="schannel">Windows TLS Stack (SChannel)</h3>
		<h4 id="schannel-alpn">ALPN Support in the Windows TLS Stack</h4>
		<p>
			The Windows TLS stack implements RFC 7301 faithfully and
			always terminates if the client and the server ALPN extensions
			are configured and the server does not recognize a supported
			protocol.
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with the Windows TLS stack
			and ALPN, the client and server should configure the supported
			ALPN protocols.
		</p>

		<h4 id="schannel-sni">SNI Support in the Windows TLS Stack</h4>
		<p>
			The Windows TLS stack provides SNI information to the TLS
			server application. It is up to the server application to handle
			SNI in an application-specific manner. The Windows TLS stack has
			no way to enforce disconnects on SNI mismatch: it does not own
			the socket, and does not have any information about the
			network. On the TLS client side, any caller-provided SNI
			information is used for server certificate validation.</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with the Windows TLS stack
			and SNI, the client should configure the SNI hostname, and the
			server should abort the handshake if the client provided an
			SNI hostname that is not recognized, using manual
			verification.
		</p>

		<h3 id="mbed">Mbed TLS</h3>
		<h4 id="mbed-alpn">Mbed TLS</h4>
		<p>
			Mbed TLS implements RFC 7301 faithfully and always terminates
			if the client and the server ALPN extensions are configured
			and the server does not recognize a supported protocol.
		</p>
		<p>
			The server and the client can enable ALPN by
			defining <code>MBEDTLS_SSL_ALPN</code> in the configuration
			script, and set the list of supported protocols
			with <code>mbedtls_ssl_conf_alpn_protocols</code> (see the
			example in <code>programs/ssl/ssl_client2.c</code>).
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with Mbed TLS and ALPN, the
			client and server should configure the supported ALPN
			protocols.
		</p>

		<h4 id="mbed-sni">SNI Support in Mbed TLS</h4>
		<p>
			Mbed TLS supports SNI with
			the <code>MBEDTLS_SSL_SERVER_NAME_INDICATION</code> setting in
			the configuration script, which is enabled by default.
		</p>
		<p>
			The client can enable SNI by setting the hostname of the
			server with <code>mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname()</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The server can set a callback function
			with <code>mbedtls_ssl_conf_sni()</code> and compare the
			hostname in the third argument with the list of supported
			hostnames. In case no match is found, the server can terminate
			the connection by returning a non-zero value from the callback
			(see the example <code>sni_callback()</code>
			in <code>ssl_server2.c</code>).
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with Mbed TLS and SNI, the
			client should configure the SNI hostname, and the server
			should abort the handshake if the client provided an SNI
			hostname that is not recognized, using manual verification.

		<h3 id="boringssl">BoringSSL</h3>
		<h4 id="boringssl-alpn">ALPN Support in BoringSSL</h4>
		<p>
			BoringSSL leaves server ALPN selection to an
			application-supplied callback. In response to our findings,
			BoringSSL has
			made <a href="https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/45504">changes to allow
				strict ALPN verification</a> by returning
			<code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</code> from this callback (same as
			OpenSSL).
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with BoringSSL and ALPN, the
			server should return <code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</code>
			in the ALPN callback to abort the connection if no matching
			protocol is found.
		</p>

		<h4 id="boringssl-sni">SNI Support in BoringSSL</h4>
		<p>
			BoringSSL implements SNI support with the application-supplied
			<a
				href="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-boringssl-docs/ssl.h.html#SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback"><code>servername</code>
				callback</a>. The application can terminate the connection by
			returning <code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beside the servername callback, there are two more SNI-related
			callbacks that offer more flexibility, and have other return
			values to indicate an
			error. The <a
				href="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-boringssl-docs/ssl.h.html#SSL_CTX_set_cert_cb"><code>cert</code>
				callback</a> can return zero on error, and
			the <a

				callback</a> can return <code>ssl_select_cert_error</code>.
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with BoringSSL and SNI, the
			server should return <code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</code>
			from the servername callback if the clients provides an SNI
			hostname that is not recognized, or equivalently return an
			appropriate error from the <code>cert</code>
			or <code>select_certificate</code> callback functions in this case.
		</p>

		<h3 id="botan">Botan</h3>
		<h4 id="botan-alpn">ALPN Support in Botan</h4>
		<p>
			The server implements a
			callback <code>tls_server_choose_app_protocol</code> which
			takes a list of the protocols offered by the client, and
			returns a string which is either empty (meaning to ignore the
			ALPN) or some protocol, or it may choose to throw an exception
			at that point which will cause the connection to be closed
			with an alert. The default implementation returns an empty
			string, thus ignoring ALPN.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the client side, the ALPN protocol list can be set in the
			<code>next_protocols</code> argument when creating
			the <code>TLS::Client</code> instance.
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with Botan and ALPN, the
			server should implement

		<h4 id="botan-sni">SNI Support in Botan</h4>
		<p>
			The server invokes a callback
			on <code>Credentials_Manager</code>, <code>cert_chain_single_type</code>,
			which asks to return a certificate chain usable for the named
			host. If the callback throws an exception if the named host
			does not match an expected hostname, then the connection will be
			closed.

		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with WolfSSL and SNI, the client
			and server should enable SNI by setting the appropriate
			compilation flags. The client should initialize it by
			calling <code>wolfSSL_UseSNI</code>. The server should implement a
			custom verification for the SNI hostname using
			the <code>wolfSSL_CTX_set_servername_callback</code>.

		<h4 id="gnutls-alpn">ALPN Support in GnuTLS</h4>
		<p>To support ALPN in GnuTLS, the client or server can call <a
				href="https://gnutls.org/reference/gnutls-gnutls.html#gnutls-alpn-set-protocols"><code>gnutls_alpn_set_protocols</code></a>
			before the handshake to configure the list of supported protocols. The function takes an array of
			<code>gnutls_datum_t</code>
			elements with protocol names. If the flag <code>GNUTLS_ALPN_MANDATORY</code> is set when calling that
			function, the connection
			is terminated when no matching protocol is found. The seelcted protocol can be obtained through
			<code>gnutls_alpn_get_selected_protocol</code>.
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with GnuTLS and ALPN, the
			client and server should call <code>gnutls_alpn_set_protocol</code> with the
			<code>GNUTLS_ALPN_MANDATORY</code>
			flag set to enforce strict ALPN verification.
		</p>

		<h4 id="gnutls-sni">SNI Support in GnuTLS</h4>

		<p>To support SNI in GnuTLS, the client should call <code>gnutls_server_name_set</code> before the handshake
			starts to set the intended server name.
			The server can retrieve the name sent by the client with <code>gnutls_server_name_get</code>.
		</p>
		<p class="important">
			To protect against ALPACA attacks with GnuTLS and SNI, the client should initialize it by
			calling <code>gnutls_server_name_set</code>, and the server should set a hook function on
			the ClientHello, call <code>gnutls_server_name_get</code> and manually verify the SNI hostname.
