    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>TLS is an internet standard to secure the communication
      between servers and clients on the internet, for example
      that of web servers, FTP servers, and Email servers. This
      is possible because TLS was designed to be application
      layer independent, which allows its use in many diverse
      communication protocols.
    </p>
    <p>ALPACA is an application layer protocol content confusion
      attack, exploiting TLS servers implementing different
      protocols but using compatible certificates, such as multi-domain
      or wildcard certificates. Attackers can redirect traffic
      from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session.
      This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks
      may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise
      the other at the application layer.
    </p>
    <p>We investigate cross-protocol attacks on TLS in general and
      conducted a systematic case study on web servers, redirecting HTTPS
      requests from a victim's web browser to SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP
      servers. We show that in realistic scenarios, the attacker can
      extract session cookies and other private user data or execute
      arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable web server,
      therefore bypassing TLS and web application security.
    </p>
    <p>We evaluated the real-world attack surface of web browsers
      and widely-deployed Email and FTP servers in lab experiments
      and with internet-wide scans. We find that 1.4M web servers
      are generally vulnerable to cross-protocol attacks, i.e., TLS
      application data confusion is possible. Of these, 119k web servers
      can be attacked using an exploitable application server. As a
      countermeasure, we propose the use of the Application Layer Protocol
      Negotiation (ALPN) and Server Name Indication (SNI) extensions to
      TLS to prevent these and other cross-protocol attacks.
    </p>
    <p>Although this vulnerability is very situational and can be challenging
      to exploit, there are some configurations that are exploitable
      even by a pure web attacker. Furthermore, we could only analyze
      a limited number of protocols, and other attack scenarios may exist.
      Thus, we advise that administrators review their deployments and
      that application developers (client and server) implement
      countermeasures proactively for all protocols.
    </p>

    <h2>Attack Overview</h2>

    <img src="media/img/alpaca-overview.png"></img>
    <p>The image shows three possible ways for an attacker to use
      cross-protocol attacks against webservers, exploiting vulnerable
      FTP and Email servers: In the Upload Attack, the attacker exfiltrates authentication cookies or other private data.
      In the Download Attack, the attacker executes a stored XSS attack.
      In the Reflection Attack, the attacker executes a reflected
      XSS in the context of the victim website.

    <h2 id="question-answer">FAQ</h2>

    <h3>I am an admin, should I drop everything and fix this?</h3>

    <p>Probably not. For the ALPACA attack to succeed, many
      preconditions need to be fulfilled. The generic attack
      requires a MitM attacker that can intercept and divert the
      victim's traffic at the TCP/IP layer. However, if you run
      application servers such as FTP and email on non-standard
      ports that are not blocked by browsers, you should make sure
      that you are not vulnerable to the web attacker variant of
      ALPACA that can affect users of Internet Explorer.</p>

    <h3>What can the attackers gain?</h3>

    <p>For the specific attacks on HTTPS described in the paper,
      the attacker can potentially steal cookies or perform a cross-site
      scripting attacks.</p>

    <p>However, the potential consequences to the general ALPACA attack are
      dependent on the interactions of two unknown protocols, so any number
      of undesirable behaviors may be possible.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is vulnerable?</h3>
    <p>This is difficult to answer. The general flaw behind ALPACA
      is within the server authentication of TLS, so potentially all TLS servers
      are affected that have compatible certificates with other TLS services.
      In regards to that, all those servers have to be considered vulnerable.
      However, for practical purposes, this definition is not very useful, as the
      flaw is exploitable only in some cases. We therefore distinguish between
      vulnerable servers and exploitable services. Our analysis was limited
      to only a few protocols and a small number of implementations, so we
      can really only make clear statements for those. From our analysis, the
      following is generally true:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sharing certificates between a Webserver and an FTP server is almost
        always dangerous if an attacker has write access to the FTP server.
        It is sometimes dangerous if the attacker has no write access.</li>
      <li>Sharing certificates between a Webserver and an SMTP/POP3/IMAP server
        is sometimes dangerous, depending on the exact behavior of the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is a list of analyzed implementations in regards to their vulnerability (see Table 3 in the paper):
      Sendmail SMTP allowed reflection attacks that work in Internet Explorer when
      used over STARTTLS. Cyrus, Kerio Connect and Zimbra IMAP servers allowed
      download and reflection attacks that work in Internet Explorer. Courier,
      Cyrus, Kerio Connect and Zimbra allowed download attacks that work in Internet Explorer. Microsoft IIS, vsftpd,
      FileZilla Server and Serv-U FTP servers allowed reflection attacks that work in Internet Explorer. And the same
      FTP servers allowed upload and download attacks that work in all browsers.</p>

    <p>But even then there are interactions with analyzed and not yet analyzed
      protocols which makes a risk estimation difficult, since we believe that
      there is a large number of yet undiscovered vulnerabilities in this area.</p>

    <p>Browsers are generally affected by the vulnerability, but they are not
      responsible for the flaw. We found that some browsers are more vulnerable
      than others because of how they react to non-HTTP responses.</p>

    <h3>So how practical is the attack?</h3>
    <p>Most attacks require an active Man-in-the-Middle attacker, that means some way
      for an attacker to intercept and modify the data sent from the victim’s browser
      to the web server. This is difficult on the Internet, but can be a plausible
      attacker model on the local network. Also, some attack variations do not
      require a Man-in-the-Browser, and thus are more dangerous. In particular,
      if you are still using Internet Explorer, we recommend you update to the
      latest version from June 8th, 2021.</p>

    <h3>Is my website/ftp-server/mail-server vulnerable?</h3>

    <p>It might be. If you are hosting several TLS-enabled application servers
      on the same hostname, or if you use multi-domain certificates, or if you
      use wild-card certificates, you may be vulnerable to the general
      confusion attack. If one of the application servers you are hosting
      has an exploitable upload, download, or reflection vector, this may
      negatively impact the security of your webserver.</p>

    <h3>Is my browser/client vulnerable?</h3>

    <p>Internet Explorer and Edge Legacy (i.e., those <emph>not</emph> based on Chrome)
      are "more" vulnerable than other browsers, because they block fewer ports and
      perform content-sniffing. Content-sniffing is dangerous, because it enables
      JavaScript code execution in server responses that are noisy due to error
      messages by the application server that implements a protocol different
      from HTTP. This means that the pure web attacker variant of ALPACA is more
      dangerous for users of such browsers than for other users.</p>
    <p>However, no browser protects the user against all possible ALPACA attacks.
      In particular, all browsers can be compromised by a Man-in-the-Middle attacker
      who has write-access to an error-tolerant FTP server presenting a certificate
      compatible with a target web server under attack. Although the FTP server can
      in theory protect against this particular attack by detecting HTTP POST requests
      and/or terminating the connection after a small number of errors, this attack
      variant shows that this is not a bug in the browser, the web server, or the
      application server, but an emergent property of the TLS landscape.</p>

    <h3>Is this a new attack?</h3>
    <p>The ALPACA attack is not fundamentally new. Cross-protocol
      attacks on HTTP were first described by Jochen Topf (2001),
      and Jann Horn presented the first attack on a TLS-secured HTTP
      connection in 2014 involving ProFTPD. We did the first systematic
      study for cross-protocol attacks against the browser exploiting
      popular SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP servers, performed an
      internet-wide scan to estimate the number of affected web
      servers, and generalized the attack away from a browser-specific
      issue to a general property of misconfigured TLS servers. We
      think that this new perspective is useful in focussing countermeasures
      on a limited number of effective options, rather than patching
      application servers one at a time as more exploits are found.</p>

    <h3>Why does TLS not protect the TCP connection endpoints?</h3>
    <p>The ALPACA attack is only possible because TLS does not protect the source
      or destination IP and port address of the TCP connection. As is stated
      in the TLS RFC, TLS is application layer independent. However, this gap
      in protection gives the attacker the flexibility to redirect traffic
      from one server to another. If the presented certificate of the
      substitute server is compatible with that of the intended server,
      the general content confusion attack is possible (although it
      depends on the server and client behavior if it can actually
      be exploited).</p>

    <h3>Can TLS mitigate these attacks at all?</h3>

    <p>Two extensions to TLS can provide some protection to the application layer
      protocol: SNI and ALPN. With SNI, the client can let the server know about
      the hostname it wants to connect to, which is useful in virtual hosting
      configurations. Sadly, SNI is often misconfigured with an insecure fallback
      to a default server, allowing content confusion attacks (for HTTP, these
      were analyzed by Delignat et al. in 2015, and Zhang et al. in 2020).
      However, the SNI standard allows the server to terminate the connection
      if the hostname does not match the expected hostname of the server,
      which would prevent some ALPACA attacks in practice. Unfortunately,
      this strict behavior is rarely implemented, even among web servers.</p>

    <p>For application servers, which commonly lag behind web servers in
      feature completeness with regards to TLS, the situation is even more
      dire. With ALPN, the client can let the server know about the intended
      protocol, which is used to demultiplex between HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2
      connections to a web server without requiring an additional roundtrip.
      Here the standard mandates strict behavior, so a server supporting ALPN
      should terminate the connection if no supported protocol is requested
      by the client. Unfortunately, this strict behavior is commonly not
      implemented, and many application servers do not even support the ALPN extension
      at all.</p>

    <h3>Why is the attack called "ALPACA"?</h3>

    <p>We initially were interested in special properties of the
      HTTP, FTP and email protocols that make cross-protocols
      practical. However, we eventually realized that the ALPACA
      attack is generic, and that the authenticity of the TLS
      connection is already compromised before any application
      layer data is exchanged. So, the original acronym
      ("Application Layer Protocols Allowing Cross-Protocol Attacks")
      was not a good fit anymore, because it is not the ALP allowing
      the attack, but the insufficiency of TLS to protect the TCP
      connection endpoints. Still, the name stuck, and we managed
      to squeeze the letters in the title in the following way:
      "Application Layer Protocol Confusion - Analyzing and mitigating
      Cracks in tls Authentication". Tortured, we know.
      But ALPACAs are still cute. :)</p>

    <h3>How have vendors responded to this vulnerability?</h3>

    <p>Many vendors have updated their application servers to remove exploitation
      vectors or add countermeasures in the application layer and/or TLS implementation.
      TLS library maintainers have reviewed the ALPN and SNI implementations and
      updated their code and documentation to allow easy implementation of
      countermeasures by developers. To prevent the attacks in the pure browser
      attacker model, browser vendors have blocked more standard application ports
      and disabled content-sniffing in more scenarios.</p>
    <p>Specific responses are listed below (please contact us if you have more info!):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer blocked more non-HTTP server ports and disabled content sniffing for HTTP requests
        to non-standard ports (<a
          href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31971">CVE-2021-31971</a>).</li>
      <li>
        Sendmail fixed a bug to detect HTTP requests when STARTTLS is used.
      </li>
      <li>Courier 5.1.0 implemented support for ALPN.</li>
      <li>FileZilla implemented countermeasures at the application and TLS layer.</li>
      <li>Vsftpd 3.0.4 implemented countermeasures at the application and TLS layer.</li>
      <li>Nginx 1.21.0 implemented mitigations at the application layer in the mail proxy.</li>
      <li>crypto/tls (Go) now <a
          href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/90d6bbbe42c15d444c1da0a1c293192d6f735a8e">enforces ALPN overlap</a>
        when negotiated on both sides.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>How is this attack related to other TLS attacks?</h3>
    <p>ALPACA uses the same attacker scenario as other TLS attacks,
      i.e. it assumes a Man-in-the-Middle attacker who can lure a
      victim to an attacker-controlled web site. However, in the
      ALPACA attack, we do not try to attack the cryptographic
      protections of TLS directly. Instead, we exploit defects
      in the configuration of TLS services, who often share
      certificates to save costs, reduce administrative work,
      or enable reverse proxy deployments where several services
      share a single, terminating TCP endpoint. In contrast to other
      TLS attacks, the attacker never compromises the confidentiality
      of the TLS connection. However, due to misconfiguration,
      authenticity and integrity are affected, allowing the attacker
      to inject some dangerous data into the connection, while
      the victim remains oblivious to the attack.</p>

    <h3>What about other protocols?</h3>

    <p>The ALPACA attack is generic, i.e. it describes the preconditions
      under which TLS traffic from the client to one server implementing
      one protocol can be redirected to another server implementing a
      different protocol, which can lead to any number of undesirable
      behavior or security vulnerabilities. We only looked at the
      combination of a HTTP client with an SMTP, IMAP, POP3, or FTP
      application server. We did not investigate any of the other
      hundreds of possible cross-protocol scenarios possible with
      current TLS enabled applications and servers. In addition,
      as TLS is more widely deployed, more protocols will be added
      to the TLS landscape, increasing the possibility of ALPACA
      attacks quadratically with the number of protocols and applications.</p>
    <p>If you find application layer protocol confusion attacks in other protocols,
      let us know! We are of course very interested in hearing about other
      affected protocols and applications.</p>

    <h3>If my clients and servers verify the ALPN and SNI parameters of the TLS handshake, will I be secure against
      this attack?</h3>
    <p>We do not think that it is feasible for clients or servers to enforce
      the use of ALPN and SNI for a long time, because doing so will exclude
      legacy clients and servers that have not been updated yet, and it is
      unlikely that this will be accepted by users or service providers.
      However, if both client and server support ALPN, and make sure that
      an acceptable protocol and hostname is negotiated, they will protect
      connections to all other servers with compatible certificates by
      the same client from almost all content confusion attacks.</p>
    <p>However, there still is some room for content confusion attacks
      even with ALPN and SNI fully deployed. If two services implement
      the same protocol on the same host, but on a different port,
      connections to one server can be redirected to another by an attacker.
      This can enable same-protocol, same-host context confusion attacks
      similar to those described by Delignat et al. (2015) and Zhang et al. (2020)
      in very specific scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Is this vulnerability really serious enough to deserve a name, a logo and a web page?</h3>

    <p>ALPACA is not a simple software bug that can be fixed with an update
      to a single library or component. Instead, clients and servers need
      to be updated to protect the connections to other (seemingly unrelated)
      servers. This means we need to raise awareness of the issue across all
      TLS-enabled applications and protocols, which is a huge effort. We expect
      that the general ALPACA attack will stay with us for many years, so we
      have a cute animal to keep us company while we help clients and servers
      to adopt the suggested countermeasures!</p>
